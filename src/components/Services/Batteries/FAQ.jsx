      question: "How do I know if my car battery needs replacing?",
      answer:
        "Common signs include slow engine cranking, dim headlights, electrical issues, or the battery warning light on your dashboard. If your car struggles to start, it’s best to get the battery tested before it fails completely.",
    },
    {
      question: "How long does a car battery last?",
      answer:
        "Most car batteries last around 3 to 5 years, depending on driving habits, weather, and vehicle use. Regular short trips or long periods without driving can shorten the lifespan.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can you test my car battery health?",
      answer:
        "Yes. We provide a free or low-cost battery health check, measuring voltage, cold-cranking amps, and charging performance to determine whether your battery needs a recharge or replacement.",
    },
    {
      question: "What’s included in your battery replacement service?",
      answer:
        "Our service includes removing the old battery, installing a new, high-performance unit, cleaning terminals, and testing the charging system to ensure everything runs smoothly before you drive away.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can a weak battery affect other parts of my car?",
      answer:
        "Yes — a failing battery can cause electronic faults, dashboard errors, and alternator strain. Replacing it early prevents breakdowns and protects your vehicle’s electrical system.",
    },
    {
      question: "Do you offer mobile battery replacement or emergency starts?",
      answer:
        "Absolutely. If your battery dies, we can come to you for a jump start or on-site replacement, getting you back on the road safely and quickly.",
    },
