      question: "Why is regular car servicing important?",
      answer:
        "Regular servicing keeps your vehicle safe, reliable, and fuel-efficient. It helps identify issues early, extends engine life, and ensures your car continues to perform at its best — saving you money on costly repairs down the line.",
    },
    {
      question: "How often should I service my car?",
      answer:
        "Most vehicles should be serviced every 12 months or 10,000 miles, whichever comes first. For high-mileage or performance vehicles, we recommend interim services every 6 months to maintain top performance and reliability.",
    },
    {
      question: "What’s included in a car service?",
      answer:
        "A standard service includes engine oil and filter change, fluid top-ups, brake and tyre checks, battery testing, and a comprehensive vehicle health inspection. Full or major services cover additional parts like air filters, spark plugs, and cabin filters.",
    },
    {
      question: "What’s the difference between an interim and full service?",
      answer:
        "An interim service covers the essentials — ideal for drivers covering lots of miles between annual services. A full service is more detailed, ensuring all critical components are inspected, cleaned, and replaced where required.",
    },
    {
      question: "Will servicing improve my fuel efficiency?",
      answer:
        "Yes — clean oil, new filters, and properly tuned parts mean your engine runs more smoothly and efficiently, helping reduce fuel consumption and emissions.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can you service my car without affecting the manufacturer warranty?",
      answer:
        "Absolutely. We follow manufacturer-approved schedules and use OEM-quality parts, ensuring your warranty remains valid and your service history stays up to date for resale value.",
    },
