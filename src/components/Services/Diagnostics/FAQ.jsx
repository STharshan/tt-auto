      question: "What is a vehicle diagnostic test?",
      answer:
        "A diagnostic test uses specialist computer equipment to read data from your car’s onboard computer. It helps identify faults in systems such as the engine, transmission, brakes, and sensors, allowing us to pinpoint issues quickly and accurately.",
    },
    {
      question: "When should I get a diagnostic test done?",
      answer:
        "You should book a diagnostic test if you see a warning light on your dashboard, notice unusual performance, or experience starting, idling, or fuel economy problems. Regular diagnostics can also help catch potential faults before they turn into costly repairs.",
    },
    {
      question: "What does a diagnostic check include?",
      answer:
        "Our diagnostics service includes scanning the vehicle’s ECU (Engine Control Unit), reading and interpreting error codes, and providing a detailed report on any faults detected. We also advise on the best repair or reset options for long-term reliability.",
    },
    {
      question: "How long does a diagnostic test take?",
      answer:
        "A standard diagnostic test usually takes around 30–60 minutes. For complex electrical or intermittent issues, we may need extra time for a full investigation, but we’ll always keep you informed.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can you fix the issues found during diagnostics?",
      answer:
        "Yes. Once the fault is identified, our technicians can carry out the necessary repairs or part replacements using high-quality components. We can often resolve the issue the same day, depending on the nature of the fault.",
    },
    {
      question: "Do you offer diagnostics for all vehicle makes and models?",
      answer:
        "Absolutely. We use the latest multi-brand diagnostic tools, compatible with most modern vehicles, including petrol, diesel, and hybrid systems. Whether it’s a family car or performance vehicle, we can accurately diagnose and repair it.",
    },
